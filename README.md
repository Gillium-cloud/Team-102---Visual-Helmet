# Team-102---Visual-Helmet
The purpose of this project is to create a helmet that provides a combination of assistive technologies, capable of producing a safe and independent lifestyle for the visually impaired. The visually impaired; Are people who are legally blind or have low vision.
Our technology has the potential to help individuals who are visually impaired, because they are often challenged by social isolation, mobility limitations, and classroom or work environments that are less than ideal. However, the lack of affordability for this assistive technology may cause a certain level of inequality.
